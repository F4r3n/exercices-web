# Exercise

## What you will learn

* Use functions
* Use iterative or recursive
* Use loop

## Instructions

It's the same exercise as lesson 1 but with different operations.
There are operations like fibonacci, factoriel and power.

### Exercise 1

In the exercise 1 of lesson 1 you used the sign '*' to multiply two numbers.
Now you will replace the sign by a function.
You will have to recreate the multiply with only additions.

```js

function multiply(left, right) {
    //Only additions
}

let result = multiply(left, right)
```

### Exercise 2


Same question as exercise 1 but with power (^), factoriel (!) and fibonacci.

For power you have to use only the additions.
Fibonacci should be solved with recursive and iterative.
