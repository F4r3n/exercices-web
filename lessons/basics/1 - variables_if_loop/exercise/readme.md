* Use variables
* Use function
* Use if/else

## Instructions

### Exercise 1

The exercise is composed with an index.html file and calculus.js file.
When you open the index.html with your browser you will see:

By clicking on the equal button "0" will appear. Try changing the numbers, 0 always appear... Fix it!

In the file calculus.js fill the function ```compute``` by using what you learnt. Get a result for '+', '-', '/'

### Exercise 2

In the exercise 1 you used the sign '*' to multiply two numbers.
Now you will replace the sign by a function.
You will have to recreate the multiply with only additions.

```js

function multiply(left, right) {
    //Only additions
}

let result = multiply(left, right)
```

### Exercise 3

[second part](2/calculus.js)

Same question as exercise 1 but with power (^), factoriel (!) and fibonacci.

For power you have to use only the additions.
Fibonacci should be solved with recursive and iterative.
